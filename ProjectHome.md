Tzura is a super primitive document layout analyzer for detection of the Gmara's Tzurat Hadaf.

(See http://mekorot.sf.net/ to see the background of this project)

Tzura exists for two reasons:

1 - To help complete the 'Mekorot' (or OpenShas) project.
> That is, to eventually extract the coordinates of all pages in the shas.

> If you'd like to participate and help accomplish that goal - please contact me <moshe.wagner -AT- gmail.com>

2 - To be an interesting educational project involving image recognition.

Tzura is still a pre-alpha release. Not only does it not fully detect the shapes on it's own, it also may crash and not work all together.
