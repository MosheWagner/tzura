Tzura is a super primitive document layout analyzer for detection of the Gmara's Tzurat Hadaf.

(See http://mekorot.sf.net/ to see the background of this project)

-----

Tzura exists for two reasons:
1 - To help complete the 'Mekorot' (or OpenShas) project. 
    That is, to eventually extract the coordinates of all pages in the shas.

2 - To be an interesting educational project involving image recognition.

----

Tzura is still a pre-alpha release. Not only does it not fully detect the shapes on it's own, it also may crash and not work all together.
